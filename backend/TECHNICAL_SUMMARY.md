# Technical Summary: Rule-Based Coffee Bean Shelf Life Prediction

## Abstract

This document provides a technical summary of the rule-based algorithm implemented for coffee bean shelf life prediction in the BeanScan application. The algorithm replaces a previous LSTM-based approach with a more interpretable and computationally efficient rule-based system.

## Methodology

### Algorithm Design

The rule-based shelf life prediction algorithm employs a multi-layered decision framework combining defect severity analysis, bean type consideration, and confidence assessment to predict coffee bean shelf life.

### Key Components

#### 1. Defect Severity Weighting
- **Mold**: 10.0 (critical health risk)
- **Insect Damage**: 8.0 (quality degradation)
- **Quaker**: 7.0 (taste impact)
- **Discoloration**: 6.0 (visual quality)
- **Physical Damage**: 4.0 (structural integrity)
- **Other Defects**: 1.0-5.0 (varying severity)

#### 2. Bean Type Base Shelf Life
- **Arabica**: 30 days (premium quality)
- **Liberica**: 28 days (good quality)
- **Excelsa**: 26 days (moderate quality)
- **Robusta**: 25 days (commercial grade)
- **Other**: 20 days (unknown/defective)

#### 3. Impact Calculation Formula
```
Impact = Weight × Confidence × Count
Total_Defect_Score = Σ(Impact_i)
Penalty_Factor = min(0.9, Total_Defect_Score / 50.0)
Predicted_Days = Base_Shelf_Life × (1 - Penalty_Factor)
```

#### 4. Critical Defect Rules
- Mold presence: `Predicted_Days ≤ 2`
- Heavy insect damage (>2 instances): `Predicted_Days ≤ 5`

## Metrics and Performance

### Algorithmic Metrics
- **Defect Score Range**: 0.0 - 50.0+
- **Penalty Factor Range**: 0.0 - 0.9 (90% max reduction)
- **Confidence Range**: 0.0 - 0.95
- **Processing Time**: < 100ms per prediction
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for inference

### Categorical Classification
| Category | Days | Confidence | Risk Level |
|----------|------|------------|------------|
| Expired | ≤ 0 | 0.95 | Critical |
| Critical | 1-3 | 0.90 | High |
| Warning | 4-7 | 0.80 | Medium |
| Good | 8-14 | 0.75 | Low |
| Excellent | >14 | 0.70 | Minimal |

### Confidence Adjustment Factors
- Multiple defect types (>3): `confidence × 0.9`
- High severity (score >20): `confidence × 0.85`
- Below threshold: Set to `threshold - 0.1`

## Tools and Technologies

### Development Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: PyTorch 1.12+, FastAPI 0.68+
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Pillow) 9.0+

    # 3. Enforce critical defect rules
    # 4. Categorize and calculate confidence
    return {
        'predicted_days': int(predicted_days),
        'category': category,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'defect_score': total_defect_score,
        'defect_counts': defect_counts
